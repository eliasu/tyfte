title: 'What tech do you like to work with?'
text: |-
  We enjoy working with modern technology that offers a great development experience and strive to continually explore how to improve when new tech emerges. So our tech stack adapts with time. We are committed to making the 'inside' of your product as polished as the outside.
  Currently, we prefer working with Tailwind for CSS questions. Statamic seems to be a solid choice for custom projects that require flexibility. Webflow can be a powerful partner when your requirements align with their limitations. Alpine.js is a valuable tool for quick frontend JavaScript. Do you have something specific in mind? Feel free to ask us.
