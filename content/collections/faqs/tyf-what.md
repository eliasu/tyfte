title: 'tyf â€“ what?'
text: '"tyfte" is an acronym for "The Yellow From The Egg." This is a literal translation of a German saying that refers to the "egg yolk" as something very positive. Mostly, it''s used to describe rather negative things as "not being the egg yolk." So, we are the good stuff, and we make the good stuff. We enjoy this German saying blending with English words. It''s a little silly, a joke, but funny, isn''t it? Furthermore, "tyfte" is phonetically a slang word that means "potato" in German. So it''s a joke within the joke. Great, concepts everywhere, do you see?'
