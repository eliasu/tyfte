title: 'Why tyfte?'
text: "Tyfte is short for »the yellow from the egg«. This is is a german saying – directly translated. So its a little joke to have an englisch name, which still sounds german even tho its englisch words. Funny isn't it? And »tyfte« is phonetically a slang word which means potato in german. So it's a joke in the joke. Great. Concepts everywhere do you see?"
